# BookCRUD-APP

A comprehensive Book CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using ReactJS for the front-end and ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end. The project allows authenticated users to perform CRUD operations on a book collection, while unauthenticated or non-admin users can only view the list of books.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login functionality for different user roles.
- **Role-based Access Control**:
  - Admin users can add, edit, delete, and view books.
  - Normal users can only view books.
- **Custom User Model**: Integrated with ASP.NET Core for user management and authentication.
- **Book Management**:
  - Add new books with details such as name, author, ISBN, and year of publication.
  - Edit and update book details.
  - Delete books.
  - View a list of all books.
- **Responsive Front-End**: Developed using ReactJS with a modern, professional UI built with Syncfusion.
- **API-based Architecture**: ASP.NET Core Web API for handling backend operations.
- **SQL Server Database**: Hosted in Azure for storing book data and user authentication details.
- **Encrypted Connection String**: Security applied for sensitive data.
- **Action-Based Login Prompt**: Login prompts appear when attempting restricted actions like add, edit, or delete.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET Core 8.0 SDK** or later
- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **SQL Server** (Azure or local)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or any preferred IDE)
- **ReactJS** (v18 or later)
- **Syncfusion** (for UI components)

## Getting Started


### Front-End Setup (ReactJS)

1. **Navigate to the front-end directory**:
   ```bash
   cd BookCURD-APP/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the React application**:
   ```bash
